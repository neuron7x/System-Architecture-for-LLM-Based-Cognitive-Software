# LLM-Oriented Instruction Blueprints

This repository contains structured instructions for designing, organizing, and optimizing cognitive software based on Large Language Models (LLMs).

## Structure
/instructions — core LLM instruction templates  
/blueprints — architectural system blueprints  
/meta — meta-instructions for instruction generation  
/use-cases — applied task-specific instruction sets  
/standards — formatting and quality standards  

## Purpose
- Centralized storage of reusable instruction patterns  
- Fast setup for production-ready LLM systems  
- Modular, structured, and adaptable content  

## Requirements
- Format: .md or .txt  
- Must include: title, purpose, usage structure  
- Minimal explanations, maximum clarity of action  

## Usage
1. Select a relevant instruction file  
2. Adapt it to your system or use case  
3. Integrate into your workflow or LLM prompt interface
